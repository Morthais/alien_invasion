# Overview


This is an Alien Invasion game I built using PyGame whilst following a tutorial in the book "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes. In Alien Invasion, the player controls a ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.

The purpose of this project was to write a simple game using a Python game framework, which in this case was PyGame. I wanted the game to have the following characteristic: The game should display graphics, The game should take user input from the keyboard or mouse, The game should have moveable objects. This game is a Work-In-Progress.


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}
